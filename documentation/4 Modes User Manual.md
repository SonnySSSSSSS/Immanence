User Manual: Immanence Engine v1

System Version: 1.0 Architecture: Local-First / Offline License: User-Owned

1. System Overview

The Immanence Engine is a constraint-based practice instrument. It does not provide advice, therapy, or algorithmic insight. It provides a structured environment to observe experience, separate fact from interpretation, regulate emotional intensity, and define values-aligned action.

The system operates on a strictly deterministic basis: it functions exactly as you instruct it, without hidden evaluation or external data processing.

Data & Privacy

    Local Storage Only: All entries, patterns, and logs are stored exclusively on your device.
    No Cloud Sync: There is no server-side backup. If you lose your device without a manual export, your data is lost.
    No Telemetry: The system does not report usage data to developers.

2. The Core Workflow

The Engine enforces a linear sequence of four modes. You cannot jump ahead without satisfying the constraints of the current mode.

Mode 1: Mirror (Observation)

Function: To establish an immutable, neutral record of an event. Constraint: You cannot proceed until the entry contains no subjective adjectives, identity labels, or assumed intent.

How to Use:

    Input Context: Enter the date, time, and location.
    Define Components:
        Actor: Who took the action? (Use names, not "The jerk").
        Action: What physically happened? (e.g., "Said," "Walked," "Emailed").
        Recipient: Who or what received the action?
    The Neutral Sentence: The system will ask you to synthesize these into a single factual statement.

Subjective (Rejected) 	Neutral (Accepted)
"John ignored me purposefully." 	"John walked past my desk without speaking."
"I failed completely." 	"I did not meet the deadline stated in the contract."
"They were aggressive." 	"They raised their voice volume above conversation level."

Troubleshooting & Constraint Resolution

System Version: 1.0 Scope: Functional blockers and input constraints.

This guide addresses mechanical and structural impediments within the Immanence Engine. The system is designed to reject ambiguous, subjective, or incomplete inputs. If you are unable to proceed to the next mode, it is likely because the current constraint has not been satisfied.

1. Mirror Mode (Observation)

Problem: "I cannot lock the Observation." System Feedback: Input Rejected: Subjective modifiers detected. or Input Rejected: Attributed intent.

Logic: The system scans for adjectives, adverbs, and mental-state verbs (e.g., "angrily," "ignored," "pretended") that imply judgment rather than physical fact.

Resolution:

    Apply the Camera Test: Ask, "Would a video camera capture this?" A camera records sound waves and movement; it does not record "rudeness" or "betrayal."
    Strip Adjectives: Remove descriptive words.
        Rejected: "He slammed the door." (Subjective intensity)
        Accepted: "He closed the door with audible force." (Observable fact)
    Remove Intent:
        Rejected: "She tried to hurt me." (Assumed intent)
        Accepted: "She said, 'You are incompetent.'" (Verbatim quote)

Problem: "The event is too complex to write in one sentence." Logic: Mirror Mode requires a single, atomic anchor point. Complex events are chains of smaller events.

Resolution:

    Select the single most distinct moment of the interaction.
    Log that single moment as the Observation.
    Use separate chains for other parts of the event if necessary.

2. Prism Mode (Interpretation)

Problem: "I cannot distinguish between 'Supported' and 'Unsupported' interpretations." System Feedback: N/A (User hesitancy).

Logic: Prism Mode forces a binary distinction. An interpretation is "Supported" only if the locked Mirror text contains the explicit evidence for it.

Resolution:

    Check the Text: Look exclusively at the locked Observation at the top of the screen.
    The Evidence Rule:
        Interpretation: "They don't respect my time."
        Observation: "They arrived at 10:15 for a 10:00 meeting."
        Verdict: Unsupported. The observation proves lateness, not lack of respect. The "lack of respect" is a narrative added to the lateness. Mark as Unsupported.

Problem: "I have too many interpretations to list." Logic: The system does not require an exhaustive list. It requires the dominant narratives.

Resolution: Log the three loudest or most persistent thoughts. Group similar thoughts under one category (e.g., group "I'm stupid" and "I always mess up" under Narrative about Self).

3. Wave Mode (Emotional Capacity)

Problem: "The intensity is too high to complete the timer." System Feedback: Session Aborted.

Logic: The system allows abortion of the Wave Ride at any time. The Immanence Engine prioritizes accurate tracking over forced completion.

Resolution:

    Press 'Abort': This stops the timer immediately.
    Log the Abort: The system will record this as "Capacity Exceeded." This is not a failure; it is a data point for the Pattern Review.
    Do Not Skip: Do not mark the mode as "Skipped" if you attempted and failed. "Aborted" provides different data than "Skipped."

Problem: "I feel nothing / I am numb." Logic: Numbness is a valid somatic state.

Resolution:

    Select Emotion: Choose "Numbness" or "Detachment."
    Somatic Scan: Locate where the lack of sensation is most prominent (e.g., "Hollow in chest," "Lack of sensation in hands").
    Run the Timer: Observe the numbness exactly as you would observe pain.

4. Sword Mode (Committed Action)

Problem: "I don't know what the 'Right' action is." System Feedback: N/A.

Logic: The system does not calculate "Rightness." It calculates "Definedness." It cannot tell you what to do; it can only ensure you have defined what you are doing.

Resolution:

    Select 'Non-Action': If you are unsure, you may choose "Conscious Non-Action."
    Define constraints:
        Action: "I will not send a text message."
        Duration: "For the next 24 hours."
    Commit: This counts as a valid Sword Mode entry.

Problem: "The system demands a 'Cost' but I don't see one." System Feedback: Input Rejected: Cost field empty.

Logic: All actions have an opportunity cost or an energetic cost. Denying the cost leads to weak commitments.

Resolution: Identify the subtle cost:

    Time: "Loss of 30 minutes."
    Social: "Potential awkwardness."
    Ego: "Admitting I was wrong."
    Comfort: "Sitting with anxiety."

5. Technical & Data

Problem: "I switched phones and my data is gone." Logic: The Immanence Engine is Local-First. There is no cloud database.

Resolution: Data cannot be recovered if the device is lost without a manual backup.

    Prevention: Go to Settings > Export Data. Save the .json file to a secure external location regularly.

Problem: "I want to delete a specific Pattern from my history." Logic: Patterns are aggregate data. You cannot delete the pattern directly; you must Archive the specific chains that contribute to it.

Resolution:

    Go to History.
    Locate the entries influencing the pattern.
    Select Archive.
    The Pattern Review will recalculate immediately.

Sample Data Set: Completed Chain

System Version: 1.0

Export ID: chain_8842_log

Date: 2025-06-14

Status: LOCKED / COMPLETED

This document illustrates a single valid entry chain within the Immanence Engine. It demonstrates how a user processes a high-stress input (a vague email) through the four modes.

1. Mirror Mode (Observation)

Context: Workplace / Digital

Input Status: LOCKED
Field 	User Input
Actor 	Manager D.
Action 	Sent email
Object 	Subject: "Urgent"
Timestamp 	09:15 AM

The Neutral Sentence (Final Locked Fact):

"At 09:15 AM, Manager D. sent an email with the subject line 'Urgent' containing the text: 'Please come to my office at 2pm today.'"

System Note: Previous attempts using words like 'demanding,' 'cryptic,' and 'scary' were rejected by the constraint filter.

2. Prism Mode (Interpretation)

Function: Assumption Testing

Anchor: The Locked Mirror Sentence above.
Interpretation (User Thought) 	Category 	Evidence Check 	Status
"I am going to be fired." 	Future Prediction 	Does the text say "fired"? No. 	Unsupported
"They found the error in the Q3 report." 	Causality 	Does the text mention Q3? No. 	Unsupported
"D. is angry with me." 	Narrative (Other) 	Does the text describe emotion? No. 	Unsupported
"A meeting is requested for 2pm." 	Future Prediction 	Does the text say "2pm"? Yes. 	Supported

Prism Summary:

    Total Interpretations: 4
    Supported: 1 (25%)
    Unsupported: 3 (75%)

3. Wave Mode (Emotional Capacity)

Function: Intensity Regulation

Status: COMPLETED

Inventory:

    Labels: Anxiety, Dread, Defensiveness.
    Somatic Location: Constriction in throat; Heat in face.
    Impulse to Act: Urge to reply immediately asking "What is this about?" or urge to message a coworker to gossip.

Wave Ride Log:

    Duration: 120 Seconds.
    Start Intensity: 8/10.
    End Intensity: 6/10.
    Action Taken During Ride? No.

System Note: Capacity Verified. User successfully observed sensation without acting on the impulse to reply immediately.

4. Sword Mode (Committed Action)

Function: Values-Aligned Execution

Status: COMMITTED

Construction:

    Value at Stake: Professionalism / Autonomy.
    Action Type: Conscious Non-Action (Restraint).
    Specific Action: "I will attend the meeting at 2:00 PM. I will not send a reply email or Slack message prior to the meeting."
    Cost of Action: "Sitting with uncertainty and discomfort for 4 hours."
    Primary Obstacle: "The internal narrative that I need to 'fix' this now."
    Time Bound: Until 2:00 PM.

Verification:

User acknowledges that silence is the active choice. Commitment locked.

Pattern Review (System Update)

Upon completion of this chain, the aggregate user statistics were updated:

    Context Frequency: "Workplace" (+1)
    Unsupported Narrative Ratio: 75% (High volume of assumption-making detected).
    Capacity Score: Valid (Impulse to act was successfully inhibited).
    Action Type: Restraint.
