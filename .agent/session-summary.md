# Session Summary - December 25, 2025

## Accomplishments
Successfully completed a major visual polish sprint focusing on Light Mode and Header integration.

### 🎨 Visual & Aesthetic Polish
- **Light Mode Vellum Aesthetic**: Added subtle parchment texture overlays to the `StatsCard` in `TrackingHub`.
- **Text Contrast**: Enhanced `ModeButton` titles in `HomeHub` with dark drop shadows for perfect readability against white/cream backgrounds.
- **Calligraphic Curve**: Implemented a variable-width, velocity-informed stroke for the 7-day performance vector in `SevenDayTrendCurve`.
- **Cloud Selection**: Relocated the cloud background switcher to the **Developer Panel** and wired it to sync with `HomeHub` via custom events.

### 🏗️ Header & Structure
- **StageTitle Integration**: Moved the `StageTitle` (Title Card) from the Hub body to the central "jewel" position in the header.
- **Header Refinement**: Constrained the title card height to match the header bar exactly and centered it vertically.
- **Version Increment**: Updated system version to `v3.14.74`.

### 📜 Documentation & Philosophy
- **README.md Overhaul**: Added a comprehensive **Progression Philosophy** section documenting:
  - **Trunk Logic**: The 12-month development timeline (remain → observe → act → carry meaning).
  - **The Removal Principle**: Focusing on removing novelty and guidance at each stage rather than adding "spiritual accumulation."
  - **Behavioral Metrics**: Prioritizing pattern weakening over declared insights.
  - **Teacher Independence**: Designing the platform to reduce dependence on creators/teachers.

## Current Version
**v3.14.74**

## Next Session Priorities
- **Continue Light Mode Refinement**: Further polish of practice components and transition effects in light mode.
- **Dark Mode Improvements**: Review and enhance dark mode aesthetics to match the recent light mode quality bar.
- **Pattern Weakening HUD**: Explore ways to surface the "what did you NOT do?" metrics in the primary UI.
