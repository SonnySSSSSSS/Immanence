# Graphics Evaluator

## Lineage (Explicit)

Grounded in:
- Josef Muller-Brockmann - Grid Systems in Graphic Design
- Robert Bringhurst - The Elements of Typographic Style

These sources define formal correctness independent of fashion.

## Purpose

Evaluate logos, symbols, icons, and marks for formal coherence, optical correctness, and symbolic legibility, then propose precise, minimal corrections that improve the mark without altering its underlying concept.

This skill answers:
- Why a mark feels unresolved
- Where its structure breaks
- How to fix it without redesigning it

## What This Skill Is Not

- Branding strategy
- Market positioning
- Stylistic preference
- Trend alignment

This is form critique, not opinion.

## Inputs

Required:
- Image of the mark (logo, icon, symbol)

Optional (recommended):
- Intended role (logo / icon / app mark / symbolic)
- Intended tone (neutral / authoritative / organic / ritual / technical)

If intent is not provided, infer conservatively and flag ambiguity.

## Core Principles (From the Sources)

From Muller-Brockmann:
- Form must be governed by an underlying order (explicit or implicit)
- Balance is optical, not geometric
- Structure precedes expression
- Reduction clarifies meaning

From Bringhurst:
- Form carries ethical responsibility
- Proportion creates calm or tension
- Rhythm governs perception over time
- Small inaccuracies accumulate into visible wrongness

## Analysis Phases (Stable Over Time)

### Phase 1 - Objective Form Reading

(No judgment)

Describe the mark in neutral terms:
- Geometry (axes, symmetry, asymmetry)
- Stroke behavior (weight, consistency, terminals)
- Curves vs angles
- Negative space
- Visual vs geometric center

If this cannot be described cleanly, the form is already suspect.

### Phase 2 - Structural Order Check

(Muller-Brockmann)

Evaluate:
- Is there an implied grid or axis?
- Are elements aligned to a coherent system?
- Does any element break order without justification?

Flags:
- Arbitrary offsets
- Inconsistent spacing
- Decorative deviations that weaken structure

### Phase 3 - Optical Balance and Weight

(Muller-Brockmann + Bringhurst)

Assess:
- Visual weight distribution
- Optical centering (not mathematical)
- Perceived tilt, sag, or heaviness

This phase often explains why a mark feels off despite symmetry.

### Phase 4 - Gestalt Resolution

(Perceptual grounding)

Check:
- Closure: does the form resolve?
- Continuity: does the eye flow cleanly?
- Figure-ground: is separation stable?
- Praegnanz: does the form reduce to a clear whole?

If the eye hesitates, identify the exact cause.

### Phase 5 - Symbolic Legibility

(Form + meaning)

Evaluate:
- Is abstraction intentional or accidental?
- Are there competing readings?
- Does reduction clarify or erase meaning?

This is especially important for symbolic or sacred marks.

### Phase 6 - Practical Reality

(Bringhurst discipline)

Test mentally:
- Small-size collapse
- Stroke loss
- Over-tight negative space
- Contrast failure

A mark that only works large is incomplete.

## Output Format (Mandatory)

The critique must be delivered in exactly four sections.

1. What the Mark Is Doing Well
   Concrete, formal observations only. No praise language.

2. Where the Form Breaks
   Each point must:
   - Identify a specific formal issue
   - Reference structure, balance, rhythm, or perception
   - Avoid vague descriptors

3. Why This Matters
   Explain the perceptual consequence:
   - instability
   - loss of authority
   - visual noise
   - symbolic ambiguity

4. Minimal Formal Corrections
   Each correction must:
   - Be specific (what to change)
   - Be minimal (no redesign)
   - Preserve the concept

If a problem cannot be fixed minimally, state that clearly.

## Hard Constraints

- No effects (glow, gradients, textures)
- No trend language ("modern", "fresh")
- No concept changes unless structurally unavoidable
- No metaphors unless the symbol explicitly requires them

## Why This Will Hold Up Long-Term

Because:
- It is grounded in structural laws, not taste
- It scales from icons to logos to symbolic marks
- It resists aesthetic drift
- It produces actionable corrections, not vibes

## Relation to Other Skill

- Visual Interaction Integrity Audit: screens, behavior, meaning
- Formal Graphic Coherence Critique: marks, form, perception

They should never be merged. They form a two-lens system.
