# Immanence OS — Philosophy & Design

## Core Philosophy

Immanence OS is a **constraint-based practice instrument**. It is not:
- A self-improvement app
- A gamified meditation tracker
- A therapy replacement
- An advice system

It is a **structured environment** for observing experience, separating fact from interpretation, regulating emotional intensity, and defining values-aligned action.

### Design Ethic

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Truth over responsiveness** | The system prioritizes accurate recognition over quick feedback |
| **Recognition over aspiration** | It observes what you do, not what you want to be |
| **Patterns over metrics** | Single numbers are avoided; behavior is understood holistically |
| **Stability over excitement** | Changes happen slowly, with hysteresis to prevent noise |
| **Humility over certainty** | The system refuses to guess; it waits until confident |

## The Avatar

The central avatar is the user's **visual representation of practice identity**. It is not a character, mascot, or reward. It is a mirror.

The avatar reflects:
- **Stage** (temporal depth) — How long you have been practicing
- **Path** (attender tendency) — What kind of attention you naturally express
- **Status** (activity state) — Recent engagement level

The avatar changes slowly. It resists short-term fluctuations.

---

## Stages: Evolution Over Time

Stages represent **accumulated practice days**. They are not achievements or levels to "beat." They are recognitions of sustained engagement.

### The Five Stages

| Stage | Days Required | Color | Visual Quality |
|-------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| **Seedling** | 0-90 | Green | Fresh, nascent, tender |
| **Ember** | 90-180 | Orange | Warming, kindling, potential |
| **Flame** | 180-270 | Gold | Radiant, established, bright |
| **Beacon** | 270-360 | Cyan | Clear, guiding, ethereal |
| **Stellar** | 360+ | Violet | Deep, cosmic, transcendent |

### Stellar Substages

After Beacon, the practitioner enters Stellar, which has three sub-phases:
- **Stellar I** (360-540 days) — Established practitioner
- **Stellar II** (540-720 days) — Deepening mastery
- **Stellar III** (720+ days) — Approaching transmission capacity

### Why These Durations?

90 days (~3 months) is the minimum meaningful period to observe behavioral stability:
- Less than 90 days: noise, motivation spikes, novelty effects
- 90+ days: genuine habit formation, sustainable patterns

The system requires **2.5 years** to reach Stellar III. This is intentional. Practice is not a sprint.

## Paths: Tendencies of Attention

Paths represent **how attention naturally behaves** during practice. They are not:
- Personality types
- Spiritual identities
- Better or worse approaches

They are **observed patterns** that emerge after sustained engagement.

### The Six Paths

| Path | Sanskrit | Symbol | Meaning |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Soma** | Body | ◈ | Practice rooted in embodiment, movement, somatic awareness |
| **Prana** | Breath | ≋ | Practice centered on breath, flow, energetic regulation |
| **Dhyana** | Mind | ◯ | Practice of stillness, mental observation, emptiness |
| **Drishti** | Vision | ◉ | Practice using focus, visualization, concentrated gaze |
| **Jnana** | Wisdom | ◇ | Practice of inquiry, reflection, insight cultivation |
| **Samyoga** | Integration | ⬡ | Balanced practice across all domains |

### Path Emergence

Paths do not appear immediately. The system requires:
- **90 days** of practice before any path emerges
- **Dominant practice** (>50% in one domain) to assign a path
- **180 days** of sustained behavior to allow a path shift

### Why Sanskrit Names?

Sanskrit terminology was chosen:
1. **Precision** — Sanskrit contemplative vocabulary is remarkably precise
2. **Neutrality** — Avoids Western psychological framing ("body type," "visual learner")
3. **Tradition** — Connects to established contemplative lineages without appropriation
4. **Humility** — Reminds users they are joining a practice tradition, not inventing one

### Samyoga: The Integration Path

Samyoga appears when:
- All domains have ≥10% of practice time
- No single domain exceeds 45%
- At least 4 domains have ≥15%

This is not "better" than other paths. It is a recognition of **distributed attention**.

## Attention Vectors: Behavioral Signatures

While Paths describe *what* you practice, Attention Vectors describe *how* attention behaves during practice.

### The Three Attention Vectors

| Vector | Sanskrit | Behavioral Signature |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Ekagrata** | एकाग्रता (One-pointedness) | Constrained continuity — sustained, stable, anchored |
| **Sahaja** | सहज (Natural) | Rhythmic low-friction return — regular, effortless, steady |
| **Vigilance** | — | Distributed field awareness — scanning, cycling, alert |

### How Vectors Differ from Paths

- **Paths**: *What* domain you practice (breath, body, mind...)
- **Vectors**: *How* your attention behaves during practice (anchored, flowing, scanning)

### Ekagrata (One-Pointed)

Attention expresses through:
- Long session durations
- High completion rates
- Low interruptions
- Deep anchoring

This is not "better focus." It is **a pattern of endurance**.

### Sahaja (Natural)

Attention expresses through:
- Regular practice rhythm
- Consistent session lengths
- Low variation week-to-week
- Effortless return to practice

This is not spiritual effortlessness. It is **low behavioral friction**.

### Vigilance (Field Awareness)

Attention expresses through:
- Active scanning across practices
- Completion of scanning cycles
- Coherent switching (not random hopping)

This is not distraction. It is **coherent distributed awareness**.

---

## Why Hysteresis?

The system uses **hysteresis**—resistance to change—in all recognition:
- Stages require 90 days to advance
- Paths require 90 days to emerge, 180 days to shift
- Attention vectors require weeks of consistent signals

### Why This Matters

Human attention is non-linear:
- It fluctuates weekly
- It regresses under stress
- It oscillates naturally

Without hysteresis:
- Identities would flip constantly
- The system would lie
- Users would be misrepresented

> If a system reacts quickly, it is untruthful.

## Inactivity & Dormancy

The system handles absence gracefully:

| Days Inactive | Status | Effect |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| 45+ | Resting | Minor visual dimming |
| 90+ | Dormant | Significant fade, but identity preserved |
| 180+ | Fading | Path confidence decays |

Inactivity does not punish. It pauses.

Life interrupts practice—illness, travel, crisis, caregiving. A system that resets identity due to life circumstances is unethical.

## The Four Modes

The Four Modes (Mirror → Prism → Wave → Sword) are a separate system for cognitive processing. They are not about meditation practice—they are about **processing specific life events**.

| Mode | Function | Sanskrit Root |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Mirror** | Neutral observation | Sakshi (witness) |
| **Prism** | Interpretation separation | Viveka (discrimination) |
| **Wave** | Emotional capacity | Titiksha (endurance) |
| **Sword** | Committed action | Sankalpa (resolve) |

See [4 Modes User Manual](../documentation/4%20Modes%20User%20Manual.md) for detailed usage.

## What This System Refuses to Do

Immanence OS explicitly refuses:
- **Prediction** — It won't tell you what will happen
- **Coaching** — It won't tell you what to do
- **Correction** — It won't tell you you're wrong
- **Moral framing** — It won't call things good or bad
- **Aspirational guidance** — It won't suggest what you should become
- **"Next step" messaging** — It won't push you toward goals

It observes. It recognizes. It waits.

---

## Privacy as Philosophy

All data stays local. This is not just a technical choice—it is a **philosophical commitment**:

1. **Contemplative data is intimate** — What you practice, how long, when you fail
2. **Surveillance distorts practice** — Knowing you're watched changes behavior
3. **Ownership preserves agency** — Your data is yours to keep or delete

No telemetry. No cloud. No remote analysis.
