# Archive Index

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but kept for reference.

## Structure

- **TASKS/** — Completed task logs (TASK-*.md files)
- **PHASES/** — Phase handoff documents (PHASE_2_*.md files)
- **SPECS/** — Old implementation specifications

## Why These Files Are Here

These files served important purposes during development but have been superseded by:

- **Task logs** → Replaced by consolidated approach in WORKLOG.md + PROJECT_STATUS.md
- **Phase docs** → Historical; current status in PROJECT_STATUS.md
- **Spec docs** → Consolidated into feature-specific docs (AVATAR_SYSTEM.md, CYCLE_SYSTEM.md, etc.)

## How to Use This Archive

1. **Historical reference**: If you need context on what was done in the past
2. **Decision rationale**: Old specs may explain "why" decisions were made
3. **Implementation details**: For complex systems, old specs may have useful detail

## When to Add Files

Move files here when:
- Task is complete and won't be referenced frequently
- Phase handoff is done and status moves to PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Implementation spec has been consolidated into feature docs
