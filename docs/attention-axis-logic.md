Good instinct. What you’re asking for here isn’t “more comments” — it’s **architectural self-knowledge**. This kind of document is what prevents a project from turning into folklore or personality-driven decision-making later.

Below is a **canonical logic document** you can drop directly into
`/immanence-os/docs/attention-axis-logic.md` (or similar).
It is written to **explain itself**, justify decisions, and survive future scrutiny — including from people who didn’t live through these conversations.

I’m not writing this as a spec for coders.
I’m writing it as a **design rationale + system philosophy + logic contract**.

# Attention Axis — Path Inference Logic

**Immanence OS | Canonical Design Documentation**

---

## 1. Purpose of This System

The Attention Axis exists to **recognize long-term patterns of engagement**, not to classify people, assign identities, or rank spiritual development.

This system does **not** attempt to measure:

* enlightenment
* depth of realization
* psychological traits
* inner effort or intention

Instead, it observes **how attention behaves over time** when interacting with the Immanence OS practices.

> The system answers one narrow question only:
> **“What pattern of constraint and freedom does this user’s attention reliably express over time?”**

---

## 2. Why Paths Are *Recognitions*, Not Labels

Most spiritual systems fail at digital translation because they:

* collapse transient states into identities
* reward behavior with praise
* mistake intensity for progress
* or turn classification into aspiration

Immanence OS explicitly avoids this.

**Paths are recognitions**, meaning:

* they emerge slowly
* they require consistency
* they can dissolve or change
* they carry no reward, status, or praise

The system never says *“you are Ekagrata.”*
It says, implicitly: *“this pattern has been consistently observed.”*

---

## 3. Why We Use Behavior Instead of Self-Report

Self-report fails for three structural reasons:

1. **People misinterpret themselves**, especially in contemplative contexts
2. **Language collapses nuance** (“focus,” “presence,” “effortless”)
3. **Self-report incentivizes aspiration**, not honesty

Therefore:

* no surveys
* no questionnaires
* no intent prompts
* no reflective tagging

The system observes **behavioral residue** only — what remains consistent when no one is asking questions.

---

## 4. The Three Attention Paths (Conceptual, Not Hierarchical)

These paths are **non-hierarchical** and **non-evolutionary**.

### Ekagrata — Constrained Continuity

Attention expresses itself through:

* sustained engagement
* stable anchoring
* persistence under constraint

This is not “better focus.”
It is **a pattern of endurance**.

### Sahaja — Rhythmic Low-Friction Return

Attention expresses itself through:

* regular return without force
* low interruption
* stable rhythm across time

This is not “effortlessness” as an inner claim.
It is **low friction at the behavioral level**.

### Vigilance — Distributed Field Awareness

Attention expresses itself through:

* scanning and re-entry
* movement across a field
* active completion of scanning cycles

This is not distraction.
It is **coherent scanning under engagement**.

---

## 5. Why No Single Metric Is Allowed to Define a Path

Early drafts attempted to use:

* duration thresholds
* session length ceilings
* completion dominance

All were rejected.

### Reason:

Any single metric smuggles metaphysics.

Examples:

* Long ≠ effortful
* Short ≠ effortless
* Scanning ≠ vigilance
* Regular ≠ advanced

**Paths are defined by patterns across constraints**, not isolated numbers.

Therefore:

* duration influences likelihood but never forces classification
* rhythm matters only in relation to interruption
* switching matters only in relation to completion
* volume matters only when sustained

---

## 6. The Architectural Principle: Constraint × Freedom

Every path is a **distinct balance** between:

* constraint (stability, structure, anchoring)
* freedom (movement, flexibility, adaptation)

| Path      | Constraint | Freedom  |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Ekagrata  | High       | Low      |
| Sahaja    | Moderate   | Moderate |
| Vigilance | Low        | High     |

This balance is never inferred directly — it **emerges from behavior**.

---

## 7. Why Hysteresis Is Mandatory

Human attention is **non-linear**:

* it fluctuates weekly
* it regresses under stress
* it oscillates naturally

Without hysteresis:

* paths would flip constantly
* the system would lie
* users would be misrepresented

Therefore:

* commitment requires months
* switching requires more evidence than initial commitment
* short-term changes are treated as “weather”

> If a system reacts quickly, it is untruthful.

---

## 8. The Role of MIXED and HYBRID_STABLE

### MIXED

Used when:

* two paths are indistinguishable in the short-to-mid term
* dominance is unclear
* the system refuses to guess

This is **epistemic humility**, not failure.

### HYBRID_STABLE

Used when:

* two paths alternate predictably
* oscillation itself is stable
* no third pattern intrudes

This recognizes that **stability can be cyclical**, not static.

---

## 9. Why PATHLESS Exists

Some practitioners:

* deliberately avoid method
* distribute practice evenly
* cultivate choiceless awareness
* or simply do not resolve into these signatures

PATHLESS exists to prevent the system from lying.

It means:

> “This user practices consistently, and none of these patterns dominate.”

PATHLESS is not:

* a failure
* a lack
* a lesser state

It is **honest non-resolution**.

---

## 10. Why Avatars and Paths Are Separated

* **Stages** represent capacity over time
* **Paths** represent tendencies of engagement

Conflating them would:

* turn paths into rewards
* incentivize performance
* destroy recognition integrity

Therefore:

* paths may influence *visual tone*
* but never unlock stages
* never gate content
* never signal progress

---

## 11. Why Inactivity Is Treated Gently (DORMANT)

Life interrupts practice.

A system that resets identity due to:

* illness
* travel
* crisis
* caregiving

…is unethical.

Therefore:

* inactivity pauses inference
* confidence decays slowly
* identity resets only after long absence

Continuity is respected unless clearly broken.

---

## 12. Why Life-Change Reweighting Is Rare

People have:

* vacations
* motivation spikes
* short intensives

These are **not transformations**.

Reweighting only occurs when:

* volume change is extreme
* sustained
* and accompanied by shape change

Otherwise, history matters.

---

## 13. What This System Refuses to Do

This system explicitly refuses:

* prediction
* coaching
* correction
* moral framing
* aspirational guidance
* “next step” messaging

It observes.
It recognizes.
It waits.

---

## 14. Design Ethic Summary

1. **Truth over responsiveness**
2. **Recognition over aspiration**
3. **Patterns over metrics**
4. **Stability over excitement**
5. **Humility over certainty**

---

## 15. Why This Documentation Exists

This document exists so that:

* future contributors don’t “simplify” it incorrectly
* future you remembers *why* these choices were made
* decisions can be defended rationally
* the system survives personality turnover

If a future change contradicts these principles,
**it must justify itself against this document.**


Appendix A — Practice Families: Rationale and Mapping Logic
A.1 Why Practice Families Exist

Practice families exist to separate attentional behavior from content, language, or tradition.

They are not spiritual categories.
They are not levels.
They are not taxonomies of wisdom.

They exist for one reason only:

To isolate what attention is being asked to do so that behavioral signals can be interpreted correctly.

Without practice families, the system would confuse:

scanning practices with distraction

relational practices with inconsistency

inquiry with fragmentation

devotion with anchoring

Practice families prevent category error in inference.

A.2 What a Practice Family Is (and Is Not)

A practice family answers this question:

“What behavioral demand does this practice place on attention?”

It does not answer:

what tradition the practice comes from

what state it aims to cultivate

whether it is beginner or advanced

whether it is spiritual, psychological, or therapeutic

A single practice family can contain practices from many traditions and domains.

A.3 The Four Practice Families
SETTLE — Single-Anchor Stabilization

Definition
Attention is invited to remain with one object and return to it when it leaves.

Behavioral demand

persistence

return to a fixed anchor

minimal intentional movement

Examples

Breath awareness

Mantra repetition

Candle or visual focus

Sound-tone following

“Stay with the circle”

Any instruction equivalent to “rest attention on X”

If the task is anchoring, it belongs here — regardless of language or symbolism.

SCAN — Distributed or Sequential Attention

Definition
Attention is invited to move across a field or sequence while remaining coherent.

Behavioral demand

intentional movement

completion of cycles

return to scanning rather than abandonment

Examples

Body scan

Noting practice

Open monitoring (when structured)

Sensory sweep

Environmental listening

Choiceless awareness (when framed as continuous observation)

Key distinction:

Movement with continuity → SCAN

Random hopping → noise (not a family)

RELATE — Attentional Engagement With Self or Other

Definition
Attention is invited to attune, care, or respond rather than anchor or scan.

Behavioral demand

emotional modulation

tolerance of vulnerability

steady return despite affective charge

Examples

Loving-kindness / compassion

Gratitude practices

Forgiveness work

Inner-child or parts work

Devotional prayer (dialogic, not repetitive)

Attunement-based practices

RELATE is defined by orientation, not repetition.

INQUIRE — Conceptual or Insight-Directed Attention

Definition
Attention is invited to examine, question, or reframe experience.

Behavioral demand

cognitive engagement

shorter, more deliberate sessions

return driven by insight rather than calm

Examples

Self-inquiry (“Who is aware?”)

Guided reflection

Cognitive reframing

Insight journaling (guided)

Philosophical contemplation

Koan-like prompts

INQUIRE is not distraction; it is active examination.

A.4 What Practice Families Deliberately Avoid

Practice families explicitly avoid:

spiritual hierarchies

lineage-based grouping

“advanced vs beginner” distinctions

emotional tone classification

outcome-based labeling

They exist solely to support accurate inference, not meaning-making.

Appendix B — Implementation Order and Rationale
B.1 Why Instrumentation Comes First

Behavioral data is irreversible.

You cannot reconstruct alive signals later

You cannot infer exit intent retroactively

You cannot recover missed pause patterns

Inference logic can evolve.
Data cannot.

Therefore:

Instrumentation must precede inference.

Even if inference is months away, event logging must begin immediately.

B.2 Why Mock Prototyping Must Run in Parallel

While instrumentation is required first, inference must not be designed blindly.

Mock data allows:

testing hysteresis logic

validating gates

identifying false positives cheaply

tuning weights without harming real users

Mock users should include:

stable single-path users

hybrids

oscillators

pathless practitioners

life-disrupted users

This is where most design flaws surface safely.

B.3 Recommended Development Sequence

Instrument all session-level events

Define weekly aggregation pipeline

Generate synthetic users and data

Run inference in isolation

Inspect via DevPanel

Only then expose inference to real users

Skipping any step introduces long-term risk.

B.4 Why Inference Should Launch in Shadow Mode

Early inference should:

run silently

log outputs

not influence UI

not be shown to users

This allows:

calibration

confidence building

internal validation

Once exposed, inference becomes narrative, not just logic.

Appendix C — Design Commitment

These appendices exist to prevent future drift.

If a future change:

weakens behavioral grounding

introduces aspirational labeling

collapses paths into rewards

or removes hysteresis for responsiveness

…it must justify itself against this document.

Appendix D — Phase 1: Instrumentation Layer (Foundational)

This phase exists to collect irreversible behavioral data required for future attention-path inference.

No inference, classification, or interpretation occurs at this layer.

This layer is intentionally:

dumb

factual

deterministic

forward-compatible

All design decisions in this phase prioritize:

accuracy over convenience

completeness over early insight

stability over responsiveness

Any future logic that attempts to infer attention paths must consume this data without modifying it.

If data is missing here, it cannot be reconstructed later.

Then append Opus’s plan verbatim, with only the corrected mapping notes applied.
